- I've been part of HackThisFall since Season 2. My role over the past years involved building the official website, community website and providing support for tech.
- For Season 4, we built the [website](https://s4.hackthisfall.tech) and a custom tweet scraper to scrape the tweets that were done during the hackathon and show them in realtime over the main screen.
