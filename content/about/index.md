Hello! I'm Apoorv, Software Engineer at [Skyflow](https://skyflow.com) based out of Delhi.

I enjoy creating things that live on the internet, whether that be websites, applications, or anything in between.

I was an MLH Fellow for Summer '22 @ [Solana Labs](https://solana.com/) where I worked with [Metaplex](https://www.metaplex.com/) under Solana Ecosystem. I was also a GitHub Extern for Winter '22 where I worked with [Symbl.ai](https://symbl.ai/) as a Software Engineering Intern. Prior to this, I worked with [Intervue](https://intervue.io) as Software Engineering Intern and [Raahee](https://raahee.in/) as Software Development Intern.

I along with my team have won [UNESCO India Africa Hackathon 2022](https://uia.mic.gov.in/) as well as [Smart India Hackathon Software Edition 2022](https://sih.gov.in/). We built solutions around around Education themed problem statement.

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
